# Makerkit - Supabase SaaS Starter Kit - Turbo Edition

This is a Starter Kit for building SaaS applications using Supabase, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.

This version uses Turborepo to manage multiple packages in a single repository.

**This project is currently under development. Please wait for the stable release before using it in production. It will undergo big changes and improvements.**

## Roadmap

The roadmap for the project is as follows:

- [x] - **March 31**: Alpha release - authentication, personal accounts, team accounts (memberships)
- [x] - **April 7**: Beta release - billing, Stripe, Lemon Squeezy, and more
- [x] - **April 14**: Release candidate - admin dashboard, translations, and more
- [ ] - **April 21**: Final Release candidate - in-app notifications, final features and improvements
- [ ] - **April 28**: Stable release - final features and improvements
- [ ] - **May 4**: Post-release - documentation, tutorials, and more

## Features

- **Authentication**: Sign up, sign in, sign out, forgot password, update profile, and more.
- **Billing**: Subscription management, one-off payments, flat subscriptions, per-seat subscriptions, and more.
- **Personal Account**: Manage your account, profile picture, and more.
- **Team Accounts**: Invite members, manage roles, and more. Manage resources within a team.
- **RBAC**: Simple-to-use role-based access control. Customize roles and permissions (coming soon).
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage users, subscriptions, and more.
- **Pluggable**: Easily add new features and packages to your SaaS application.
- **Super UI**: Beautiful UI using Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS.

The most notable difference between this version and the original version is the use of Turborepo to manage multiple packages in a single repository.

Thanks to Turborepo, we can manage and isolate different parts of the application in separate packages. This makes it easier to manage and scale the application as it grows.

Additionally, we can extend the codebase without it impacting your web application.

Let's get started!

## Quick Start

### 0. Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- Docker
- Pnpm
- Supabase account (optional for local development)
- Payment Gateway account (Stripe/Lemon Squeezy)
- Email Service account (optional for local development)

Clone this repository with the command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:makerkit/next-supabase-saas-kit-turbo
```

If your SSH key isn't set - then use the HTTPS.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/makerkit/next-supabase-saas-kit-turbo
```

Now, remove the original `origin`:

```bash
git remote rm origin
```

Add upstream pointing to this repository so you can pull updates

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:makerkit/next-supabase-saas-kit-turbo
```

Once you have your own repository, do the same but use `origin` instead of `upstream`

To pull updates (please do this daily with your morning coffee):

```bash
git pull upstream main
```

This will keep your repository up to date.

#### 0.1. Install Pnpm

```bash
# Install pnpm
npm i -g pnpm
```

### 1. Setup dependencies

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm i
```

### 2. Start the development server

```bash
# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

This command will run the web application.

Please refer to `apps/web/README.md` for more information about the web application.

To get started right away, use the credentials below:

- **Email**: `test@makerkit.dev`
- **Password**: `testingpassword`

#### Turbopack

Makerkit uses Turbopack by default. Turbopack is the new bundler for Next.js - and it is still experimental. It is faster, but it may have some issues.

If you encounter any issues, you can switch to the default Next.js by removing the flag `--turbo` from the `dev` command in `apps/web/package.json`.

### 3. Start the Supabase server

To start the Supabase server, you can use the following command:

```bash
# Start the Supabase server
pnpm run supabase:web:start
```

This command runs the Supabase server locally for the app `web`.

Should you add more apps, you can run the following command:

```bash
# Start the Supabase server for the app `app-name`
pnpm run supabase:app-name:start
```

Instead, to stop the Supabase server, you can use the following command:

```bash
# Stop the Supabase server
pnpm run supabase:web:stop
```

To generate the Supabase schema, you can use the following command:

```bash
# Generate the Supabase schema
pnpm run supabase:web:typegen
```

## Architecture

This project uses Turborepo to manage multiple packages in a single repository.

### Apps

The core web application can be found in the `apps/web` package.

Here is where we add the skeleton of the application, including the routing, layout, and global styles.

The main application defines the following:

1. **Configuration**: Environment variables, feature flags, paths, and more. The configuration gets passed down to other packages
2. **Routing**: The main routing of the application. Since this is file-based routing, we define the routes here.
3. **Local components**: Shared components that are used across the application but not necessarily shared with other apps/packages.
4. **Global styles**: Global styles that are used across the application.

### Packages

Below are the reusable packages that can be shared across multiple applications (or packages).

- **`@kit/ui`**: Shared UI components and styles (using Shadcn UI and some custom components)
- **`@kit/shared`**: Shared code and utilities
- **`@kit/supabase`**: Supabase package that defines the schema and logic for managing Supabase
- **`@kit/i18n`**: Internationalization package that defines utilities for managing translations
- **`@kit/billing`**: Billing package that defines the schema and logic for managing subscriptions
- **`@kit/billing-gateway`**: Billing gateway package that defines the schema and logic for managing payment gateways
- **`@kit/email-templates`**: Here we define the email templates using the `react.email` package.
- **`@kit/mailers`**: Mailer package that abstracts the email service provider (e.g., Resend, Cloudflare, SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)
- **`@kit/monitoring`**: A unified monitoring package that defines the schema and logic for monitoring the application with third party services (e.g., Sentry, Baselime, etc.)
- **`@kit/database-webhooks`**: Database webhooks package that defines the actions following database changes (e.g., sending an email, updating a record, etc.)
- **`@kit/cms`**: CMS package that defines the schema and logic for managing content
- **`@kit/next`**: Next.js specific utilities

And features that can be added to the application:

- **`@kit/auth`**: Authentication package (using Supabase)
- **`@kit/accounts`**: Package that defines components and logic for managing personal accounts
- **`@kit/team-accounts`**: Package that defines components and logic for managing team
- **`@kit/admin`**: Admin package that defines the schema and logic for managing users, subscriptions, and more.

And billing packages that can be added to the application:

- **`@kit/stripe`**: Stripe package that defines the schema and logic for managing Stripe. This is used by the `@kit/billing-gateway` package and abstracts the Stripe API.
- **`@kit/lemon-squeezy`**: Lemon Squeezy package that defines the schema and logic for managing Lemon Squeezy. This is used by the `@kit/billing-gateway` package and abstracts the Lemon Squeezy API. (Coming soon)
- **`@kit/paddle`**: Paddle package that defines the schema and logic for managing Paddle. This is used by the `@kit/billing-gateway` package and abstracts the Paddle API. (Coming soon

The CMSs that can be added to the application:

- **`@kit/wordpress`**:  WordPress package that defines the schema and logic for managing WordPress. This is used by the `@kit/cms` package and abstracts the WordPress API.
- **`@kit/contentlayer`**: Contentlayer package that defines the schema and logic for managing Contentlayer. This is used by the `@kit/cms` package and abstracts the Contentlayer API. Set to be replaced.

Also planned (post-release):

- **`@kit/notifications`**: Notifications package that defines the schema and logic for managing notifications
- **`@kit/plugins`**: Move the existing plugins to a separate package here
- **`@kit/analytics`**: A unified analytics package to track user behavior

### Application Configuration

The configuration is defined in the `apps/web/config` folder. Here you can find the following configuration files:

- **`app.config.ts`**: Application configuration (e.g., name, description, etc.)
- **`auth.config.ts`**: Authentication configuration
- **`billing.config.ts`**: Billing configuration
- **`feature-flags.config.ts`**: Feature flags configuration
- **`paths.config.ts`**: Paths configuration (e.g., routes, API paths, etc.)
- **`personal-account-sidebar.config.ts`**: Personal account sidebar configuration (e.g., links, icons, etc.)
- **`team-account-sidebar.config.ts`**: Team account sidebar configuration (e.g., links, icons, etc.)

## Installing a Shadcn UI component

To install a Shadcn UI component, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add <component> --path=packages/src/ui/shadcn
```

For example, to install the `Button` component, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button --path=packages/src/ui/shadcn
```

We pass the `--path` flag to specify the path where the component should be installed. You may need to adjust the path based on your project structure.

## Environment Variables

The majority of the environment variables are defined in the `apps/web/.env` file. These are the env variables 
shared between environments (eg. they will be the same for development, staging, and production).

**NB: You will not add any secret keys or sensitive information here.** Only configuration, paths, feature flags, etc.

```bash
# SHARED ENVIROMENT VARIABLES
# HERE YOU CAN ADD ALL THE **PUBLIC** ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES THAT ARE SHARED ACROSS ALL THE ENVIROMENTS
# PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY CONFIDENTIAL KEYS OR SENSITIVE INFORMATION HERE
# ONLY CONFIGURATION, PATH, FEATURE FLAGS, ETC.
# TO OVERRIDE THESE VARIABLES IN A SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT, PLEASE ADD THEM TO THE SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT FILE (e.g. .env.development, .env.production)

6. **NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TEAM_ACCOUNTS** - to disable team accounts
7. **NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TEAM_ACCOUNTS_CREATION** - to enable/disable the ability to create a team account

### Production Environment Variables

When going to production, you will need to define the environment variables in the `apps/web/.env.production` file.

```bash
# SITE
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=
```

If you use Stripe, also add:

```bash
# STRIPE
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
```

From your CI, please add the following environment variables:

```bash
# SUPABASE
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
```

If you use Stripe, also add:

```bash
# STRIPE
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
```

### Database Webhooks

Finally, you need to set a secret `SUPABASE_DB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` that your server and your Supabase instance will share in order to authenticate the requests.

```bash
SUPABASE_DB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=**************************************************
```

Make it a strong secret key - and make sure to keep it secret!

Now, you need to deploy the Supabase DB webhooks to your Supabase instance. 

Please copy the webhooks (written with Postgres SQL) from apps/web/supabase/seed.sql and make sure to replicate them to the Supabase instance.

Make sure to add the following header `X-Supabase-Event-Signature` with the value of the `SUPABASE_DB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to the request.

In this way - you server will be able to authenticate the request and be sure it's coming from your Supabase instance.

As the endpoint, remember to use the `/api/db/webhook` endpoint. If your APP url is `https://myapp.vercel.app`, the endpoint will be `https://myapp.vercel.app/api/db/webhook`.

#### Adding Database Webhooks from Supabase Studio

While you can create a migration to add the database webhooks, you can also add them from the Supabase Studio.

1. Go to the Supabase Studio
2. Go to Database->Webhooks
3. Click on "Enable Webhooks"
4. Click on "Create a new hook"

Now, replicate the webhooks at `apps/web/supabase/seed.sql` using the UI:

1. Please remember to set the `X-Supabase-Event-Signature` header with the value of the `SUPABASE_DB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to the request.
2. Please remember to set the endpoint to `/api/db/webhook` using your real APP URL. If your APP URL is `https://myapp.vercel.app`, the endpoint will be `https://myapp.vercel.app/api/db/webhook`.
3. Use 5000 as the timeout.

## Authentication

From your Supabase dashboard, please visit Authentication->URL Configuration and set the following:

- **Site URL**: The URL of your application (e.g., `http://mypp.com`)
- **Redirect URLs**: The URL to redirect the user after signing in (e.g., `http://myapp.com/auth/callback`)

Remember to update the mailing sender in Supabase too, as the default sender is most likely going to spam and has very limited quota.

You can do so from Settings->Authentication->SMTP Settings.

## Development Gotchas

When you update the repository - I found it best to clear the workspaces and reinstall the dependencies.

```bash
pnpm run clear:workspaces
pnpm run clear
```

Then, reinstall the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

PNPM is so fast this won't take long.

Sometimes - you will see errors when running the Dev Server (sometimes it's Turbopack, and sometimes pnpm uses a different version of React).

While I figure this stuff out, in these cases, please re-run the Dev Server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

If necessary, repeat the process above.

## Deploying to Vercel

Deploying to Vercel is straightforward. You can deploy the application using the Vercel CLI or the Vercel dashboard.

No additional configuration is needed to deploy the application to Vercel. If you want to opt-in to the Edge Runtime, please follow the instructions below (except for the Cloudflare CLI installation).

Since Vercel Edge runtime uses Cloudflare, the steps are similar to deploying to Cloudflare.

## Deploying to Cloudflare 🔥

To deploy the application to Cloudflare, you need to do the following:

1. Opt-in to the Edge runtime
2. Using the Cloudflare Mailer
3. Install the Cloudflare CLI
4. Switching CMS
5. Setting Node.js Compatibility Flags

### 0. Limitations

Before you continue, **please evaluate the limitations of the Edge runtime**. The Edge runtime does not support all Node.js features, so you may need to adjust your application accordingly.

Cloudflare is cheaper and faster than many other providers, but running your application on Cloudflare Workers means not having access to the vast Node.js ecosystem.

Makerkit uses Cloudflare as a baseline, so you can deploy it to Cloudflare Workers without any issues. However, you will need to keep in mind the limitations of the Edge runtime when adding new features.

One more thing to consider is that the Edge runtime does run close to your users, but may run far from your database. Consider read replicas or other strategies to reduce latency in all situations.

If your mind is set on using Cloudflare, please follow the instructions below.

### 1. Opting into the Edge runtime

To opt-in to the Edge runtime, you need to do the following: open the root layout file of your app `apps/web/app/layout.tsx` and export the const runtime as `edge`:

```tsx
export const runtime = 'edge';
```

This will enable the Edge runtime for your application.

### 2. Using the Cloudflare Mailer

Since the default library `nodemailer` relies on Node.js, we cannot use it in the Edge runtime. Instead, we will use the Cloudflare Mailer or the Resend Mailer.

To use the Cloudflare Mailer, you need to do the following. Set the `MAILER_PROVIDER` environment variable to `cloudflare` in the `apps/web/.env` file:

```bash
MAILER_PROVIDER=cloudflare
```

Setup SPF and DKIM records in your DNS settings.

Please follow [the Vercel Email documentation](https://github.com/Sh4yy/vercel-email?tab=readme-ov-file#setup-spf) to set up the SPF and DKIM records.

Alternatively, you can use the Resend Mailer. Set the `MAILER_PROVIDER` environment variable to `resend` in the `apps/web/.env` file:

```bash
MAILER_PROVIDER=resend
```

And provide the Resend API key:

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

### 3. Installing the Cloudflare CLI

Please follow the instructions on the [Cloudflare documentation](https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages/tree/main/packages/next-on-pages#3-deploy-your-application-to-cloudflare-pages) to install the Cloudflare CLI.

### 4. Switching CMS

By default, Makerkit uses Keystatic as a CMS. Keystatic's local mode (which relies on the file system) is not supported in the Edge runtime. Therefore, you will need to switch to another CMS.

At this time, the other CMS supported is WordPress. Set `CMS_CLIENT` to `wordpress` in the `apps/web/.env` file:

```bash
CMS_CLIENT=wordpress
```

More alternative CMS implementations will be added in the future.

If you leave Keystatic (or any unsupported CMSs) - it'll deploy, but it won't be able to fetch the content so you'll see a 500 error.

### 5. Setting Node.js Compatibility Flags

Cloudflare requires you to set the Node.js compatibility flags. Please follow the instructions on the [Cloudflare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs).

Please don't miss this step, as it's crucial for the application to work in the Edge runtime.

## Super Admin

The Super Admin panel allows you to manage users and accounts.

To access the super admin panel at `/admin`, you will need to assign a user as a super admin.

To do so, pick the user ID of the user you want to assign as a super admin and run the following SQL query:

```sql
UPDATE auth.users SET raw_app_meta_data = raw_app_meta_data || '{"role": "super-admin"}' WHERE id='<user_id>';
```

Please replace `<user_id>` with the user ID you want to assign as a super admin.

## How to approach Local Development

Supabase's hosted Studio is pretty great - but I don't think it should be used to perform schema changes. Instead, I recommend using your local Supabase Studio to make the changes and then generate the migration file. Then, you can push the migration to the remote Supabase instance.

At this point, you have two options:

1. create a migration with `pnpm --filter web supabase migration new <name>` and update the code manually
2. or, use the local Supabase Studio to make the changes and then run `pnpm --filter web supabase db diff -f <name>` which will generate the migration file for you. DOUBLY CHECK THE FILE!

Once you've tested it all and are happy with your local changes, push the migration to the remote Supabase instance with `pnpm --filter web supabase db push`.

Doing the opposite is also okay - but:
1. You're making changes against the production database - which is risky
2. You're not testing the changes locally - which is risky
3. You need to pull the changes from the remote Supabase instance to your local instance so they are in sync

My two cents - but you do you - anything that works for you is good.

## Going to Production

When you are ready to go to production, please follow the checklist below. This is an overview, a more detailed guide will be provided in the future.

This could take a couple of hours, so buckle up!

1. **Create a Supabase project**. Link the project locally using the Supabase CLI (`supabase link`).
2. **Migrations**: Push the migrations to the remote Supabase project (`supabase db push`).
3. **Auth**: Set your APP URL in the Supabase project settings. This is required for the OAuth flow. Make sure to add the path `/auth/callback` to the allowed URLs. If you don't have it yet, wait.
4. **Auth Providers**: Set the OAuth providers in the Supabase project settings. If you use Google Auth, make sure to set it up. This requires creating a Google Cloud project and setting up the OAuth credentials.
5. **Auth Emails**: It is very much recommended to update the auth emails using the [following documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/email-based-auth-with-pkce-flow-for-ssr#update-email-templates-with-url-for-api-endpoint). The kit already implements the `confirm` route, but you need to update the emails in your Supabase settings.
6. **Deploy Next.js**: Deploy the Next.js app to Vercel or any another hosting provider. Copy the URL and set it in the Supabase project settings.
7. **Environment Variables**: The initial deploy **will likely fail** because you may not yet have a URL to set in your environment variables. This is normal. Once you have the URL, set the URL in the environment variables and redeploy.
8. **Webhooks**: Set the DB Webhooks in Supabase pointing against your Next.js app at `/api/db/webhooks`.
9. **Emails**: Get some SMTP details from an email service provider like SendGrid or Mailgun or Resend and configure the emails in both the Environment Variables and the Supabase project settings.
10. **Billing**: Create a Stripe/Lemon Squeezy account, make sure to update the environment variables with the correct values. Point webhooks from these to `/api/billing/webhook`.
